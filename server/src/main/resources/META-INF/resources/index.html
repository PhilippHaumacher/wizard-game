<h2>Multi player online card game following the rules of Wizard</h2>

<p>
With the <i>Zauberer</i> app, you can meet up with your friends to play cards - without the hassle of shuffling cards 
and writing down points. The game follows the rules of the legendary card game "Wizard" by Ken Fisher. The flow 
is as follows:

<p>
You log in and see a list of open games that are still looking for players. You can either join an open game
game or create your own game. After you start the game, up to 20 rounds will be played, depending on the number of 
players.
</p>

<p>
In each round, each player first makes a prediction of how many tricks he thinks he will make in that round. 
Then each player in turn lays a card. The player who played the highest card takes the trick. 
Points are awarded only to those players who have made as many tricks as they predicted at the beginning.
After all rounds are played, the player who has made the most points wins.
